# Labyrinth

* Implement the "Labyrinth" game (aka "Terra Incognita").
  - [Labyrinth (Wiki)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinth_(paper-and-pencil_game))
  - [Terra Incognita](https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/terra-incognita)
* You should use the knowledge obtained during the course.
* Design the game using:
  - Interfaces (OOP-like)
  - Inversion of Control
  - Dependency Injection
  - Proper layering
  - Proper project structure
  - Diagrams of classes and interaction between classes
* The code should be extensible enough to support new upcoming requirements (see "Mandatory set of rules" and "Extended set of rules").

### Functional requirements

* "Labyrinth" is a one-player turn-by-turn game which should be implemented as a console application.
  - Game consists of labyrinth, labyrinth objects, user inventory, CLI interface.
  - Computer is a master of game.
  - Game is controlled by text commands.
  - Initially, the player can't see the labyrinth. The player should explore the labyrinth on its own.
* User commands:
  - Starting a new game with a predefined labyrinth size: "start <labirynth_size>". Labyrinth size should be not less 4 and not bigger 10.
  - Quiting the current game: "quit" (without saving).
  - Quiting the current game with saving: "save <file_name>" (the game should be saved into a text file).
* On the start, labyrinth should be randomly generated.
  - Labyrinth consists of cells.
  - A wall can be built between any two neighbouring cells.
  - An outside wall is called monolith.
  - There should be no inaccessible cells.
  - There should be one exit randomly dislocated in the monolith wall.

##### Mandatory set of rules

* Game flow:
  - Player's goal to find a treasure and leave the labyrinth.
  - Games starts after the labyrinth is generated.
  - On the start, player is invited to enter commands.
  - Game prints the results of processing the commands.
  - Game ends when the player leaves the labyrinth with a treasure.
  - If the player doesn't have a treasure found, the game should say he can't leave the labyrinth on attempt to pass through the exit.
* Game objects:
  - Treasure.
  - 5 wormholes, organized into a cyclic ordered set. Entering a wormhole moves the player into the next wormhole by index. Skipping a move while staying on the wormhole moves the player to the next wormhole.
* User commands:
  - Moving: "go up", "go down", "go left", "go right".
  - Skipping a turn: "skip".
* Game messages:
  - "step impossible, wall"
  - "step executed, wormhole"
  - "step executed, treasure"
  - "step impossible, monolith"
  - "step executed" (on successfull moving)

##### Extended set of rules

* To be defined soon.
